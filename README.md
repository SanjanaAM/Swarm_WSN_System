üõ∞Ô∏è**Securing Wireless Sensor Networks: Swarm-Enabled Intrusion Detection Against Black Hole Attacks**

This project focuses on designing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) using swarm intelligence ‚Äî specifically, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) ‚Äî to detect and mitigate Black Hole Attacks.

üîç About the Project

Black Hole Attacks pose a significant threat to WSNs by dropping all packets passing through a malicious node. This project implements and compares ACO and ABC algorithms to:
- Optimize feature selection
- Detect intrusion patterns
- Improve IDS accuracy in resource-constrained environments

üéØ Project Objectives
- Develop a swarm intelligence-based framework to detect dynamic Black Hole Attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks.
- Enhance IDS performance in real-time by balancing detection accuracy with energy efficiency.
- Integrate and evaluate ACO and ABC algorithms for improving security in resource-constrained WSN environments.

‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms Implemented

- **ACO (Ant Colony Optimization)**: Mimics ant foraging behavior to find optimal paths and patterns in network traffic.
- **ABC (Artificial Bee Colony)**: Inspired by bee search patterns to optimize the detection of abnormal node behavior.
